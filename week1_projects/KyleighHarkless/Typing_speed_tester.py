"""Create a new folder: your_name/typing_speed_tester/
Add main script: typing_speed_tester.py
Include a sample prompt in code (or load from prompts.txt)
Display the prompt clearly and start timing when user begins typing
Stop timing when user submits input (e.g., presses Enter)

Calculate:
Time taken (seconds)
WPM using: WPM = (characters_typed / 5) / minutes_elapsed
Accuracy (%) using: accuracy = (correct_chars / total_chars_typed) * 100
Print a neat summary with:

Prompt length (chars & words)
Time taken
WPM
Accuracy

Add README.md explaining:

What the project does
How to run it
Example input/output

(Optional) Add requirements.txt (if you use any libraries)"""
