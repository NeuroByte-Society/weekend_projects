# Chat Simulator Project

## What the project does
This is a simple command-line chatbot built in Python. It responds to basic greetings, tells the time and date, and can exit the chat on command.

## How to run
1. Run the Python script:



git checkout -b yaswanth-chat-simulator



git add week1_projects/yaswanthkumarch/chat_simulator/
git commit -m "Yaswanth – Chat Simulator Project"
git push origin yaswanth-chat-simulator



This pull request adds a simple command-line Chat Simulator built in Python.

Features include:
- Greeting the user
- Responding to basic questions such as "What's your name?" and "What's the time?"
- Responding differently based on keywords in user input
- Allowing the user to exit the chat by typing keywords like "bye" or "exit"
- Keeping a conversation history stored in a list

The project demonstrates the use of Python syntax, conditional statements, loops, and basic CLI interaction.

Looking forward to feedback and suggestions. Thank you!
